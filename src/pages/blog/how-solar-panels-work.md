Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, convert sunlight into electricity. They are made up of a series of interconnected solar cells that are typically made of silicon.

When sunlight hits the solar cells, it causes a flow of electrons, which generates a direct current (DC) of electricity. The electricity is then sent to an inverter, which converts the DC electricity into alternating current (AC) electricity, which is the type of electricity that is used in homes and businesses.

The AC electricity is then sent to the electrical panel, where it can be used to power lights, appliances, and other devices. Any excess electricity that is not used is sent back to the grid, which can then be used by other homes and businesses.

It's also important to note that solar panels require direct sunlight to generate electricity. This means that they are most efficient in sunny and warm climates, but they can still generate electricity in other climates, albeit at a lower efficiency.

Solar panels can be installed on the roof of a home or business, or they can be mounted on a separate structure, such as a ground-mounted solar array. They can also be integrated into other products, such as solar-powered streetlights or solar-powered water pumps.

In summary, solar panels work by converting sunlight into electricity through a process known as photovoltaics. The electricity is then converted into the type of electricity used in homes and businesses, and can be used to power lights, appliances, and other devices. Excess electricity can also be sent back to the grid.
